I will create a new landing page for your WebBank project. This page will serve as the primary entry point for new and unauthenticated users, featuring a modern hero section with a professional design.

Here’s the plan:

1.  **Hero Section:** I will build a prominent hero section containing:
    *   A large, engaging headline: **"Your Financial Future, Together."**
    *   A sub-headline explaining the value proposition.
    *   Primary call-to-action buttons for **"Register / Join Now"** and **"Request Loan"**.
    *   A secondary button to **"Learn More"**.
    *   A dynamic stats section displaying **Total Members**, **Total Loan Payouts**, and **Years Active**.

2.  **Visual Design:** The page will have a clean, modern aesthetic. For the background of the hero section, I will use a high-quality, abstract SVG illustration to create a visually appealing and professional look.

3.  **Technology:** I will build this page using a new Django template (`index.html`) and add specific CSS rules to your existing stylesheet for the new components, ensuring it integrates smoothly with your project.

4.  **Implementation:** The page will be mapped to the root URL of your site, replacing the current default redirect for unauthenticated users.

Do you approve of this plan?
