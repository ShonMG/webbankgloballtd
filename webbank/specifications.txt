Hello Shawn,

I trust you are well. Apologies once again for the delayed follow-up.

Further to our earlier feedback, we would like to clearly clarify the loan calculation logic, especially on interest rates and how the interest should be distributed for members and non-members.

1. Non-Member Loan Calculation (20% Interest)

For non-member loans, the total interest rate remains 20%, distributed as follows:

2% – Webbank

8% – Guarantor

10% – Distributed among all members

The loan calculator should clearly show:

Total interest charged

Exact amounts allocated to Webbank, guarantor, and members

What the borrower pays in total

In case of loan default, the guarantor should be able to see that they are responsible for:

The defaulted loan amount plus the full 20% interest

The system should also show that:

The guarantor earns their 8% interest immediately upon loan disbursement

This interest can either:

Be credited as the guarantor’s shares, or

Be withdrawn immediately via M-Pesa

2. Member Loan Applications

For members borrowing loans, interest should be calculated as follows:

Short-term loans: 10% interest(one month)

Long-term loans: 1% per month

The calculator should:

Automatically calculate interest based on loan type (short-term or long-term)

Include a major calculator logic that distributes the earned interest among all members

3. Landing Page Update

Additionally, on the landing page, instead of displaying the number of people, we would like it to display the number of shares. --done

Kindly confirm if the above logic can be implemented and share the expected timelines.


Looking forward to your feedback.
