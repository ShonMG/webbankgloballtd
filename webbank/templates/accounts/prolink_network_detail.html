            <p class="text-secondary">Because members act as promoters of one another’s businesses, due diligence is critical. Before referring any business, members must ensure:</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="text-secondary">If a business does not meet the required standards, the owner is guided on areas for improvement. They may reapply after 21 days once improvements are made.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary">Due diligence should be made by members who are conversant with that business field.</p>
